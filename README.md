# Algorithms
Implementation of popular algorithms / data structures and related coursework

## Algorithms specialization Stanford
This directory contains implementations of algorithms covers in series of books *Algorithms Illuminated* by Tim Roughgarden.
Some of the algorithms have more than one implementation. Currently covered algorithms:
* Karatsuba's integer multiplication
* merge sort
## Other
Implementation of other popular algorithms. I try to mention source I draw inspiration from as often as possible
(e.g. CLRS for insertion sort). Currently covered algorithms:
* insertion sort
* finding nth element of Fibonacci sequence
* word break
